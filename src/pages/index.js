I have had a bit of a meandering path to end up where I am now. After earning my undergrad in Technical Communications I then went Miami Ad School to study Art Direction. At some point I came to the realization I wanted to actually build the websites I had been designing. I went through Prime Academy, a web development boot camp, and have been working as a Front-End Developer since 2015.</p>
