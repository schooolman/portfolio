                            <p>Originally hailing from Minneapolis, Minnesota, I have now found my way to the amazing city of Chicago. I'm currently working as a Front End Web Developer, and while I don't have what some would call a typical career path, I feel as though I have had one that is unique to me, and speaks to who I am. I started off completing my undergraduate degree in Technical Communications at Metropolitan State University in St Paul, MN.</p>

                            <p>After, I had a burning desire to break into the advertising world and since I loved art and design, I decided that Art Direction would be my next stop. I went to Miami Ad School for their Art Direction program, and this is when I realized that while I enjoyed designing digital experiences I wanted to learn how to build them.</p>

                            <p>This brings us to my time at Prime Academy, a full stack development bootcamp started adjacent to The Nerdery. Over the next 20 weeks I learned everything I could about the MEAN stack, from smaller personal projects, to a bigger team project for a pro-bono "client". The program was a fantastic experience for me, and it launched me into the next phase of my life and career. With a job offer in hand a week before graduating the program I have continued to learn and grow every day since. My motto has always been to learn one new thing everyday, and I stick by it.</p>
